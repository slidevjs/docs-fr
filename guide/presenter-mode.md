<<<<<<< HEAD
Cliquez sur le bouton <carbon-user-speaker class="inline-icon-btn"/> dans le panneau de navigation ou visitez manuellement `http://localhost:3030/presenter` pour accéder au mode présentateur. Chaque fois que vous entrez en mode présentateur, les autres instances de page resteront automatiquement synchronisées avec le présentateur.
=======
Click the <carbon-user-speaker class="inline-icon-btn"/> button in the navigation panel, or visit `http://localhost:3030/presenter` manually, to enter the presenter mode. To present, you'll want to open two browser windows, one for the presenter and one for the audience. Generally maximizing the slideshow window on your projector screen, then controlling it from your laptop's screen is how people present with Slidev.

Whenever you change slides in the presenter mode, all other page instances will automatically change as well, to stay in sync with the presenter.

## Disabling

Presenter mode is enabled by default.

You can disable this feature with the following config:

```md
---
presenter: false
---
```

Alternately you can enable it only for `dev` or `build` modes by setting the mode you want in the config:

```md
---
presenter: dev
---
```

In that case the presenter will only be available when running `slidev` but not when running `slidev build`.

## Remote restricted access

You can run your presentation with remote access by running `slidev --remote`.

If you want to share your slides with other people but you don't want them to access the presenter mode (either because you're ashamed of your presenter notes, or because you don't want them to mess up your presentation), you can provide a password to protect the presenter server by running `slidev --remote=your_password`.

In that case you will need to provide the password when accessing `/presenter/*` routes.
