You can visit an overview of all of your slides by clicking the <carbon-apps class="inline-icon-btn"/> button in the navigation panel and then <carbon-list-boxes class="inline-icon-btn"/> on the top right, or by visiting `http://localhost:3030/overview` directly.

The overview page gives you a linear list of all your slides, with all of your notes on the side. You can double click on the notes to edit the notes directly, or drag the clicks sliders to preview the steps in your slides.
